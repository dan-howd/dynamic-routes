# Sinatra Dynamic Routes Lab

## TEACHER OUTLINE

This lab will test students' abilities to create dynamic routes. They should understand and be able to implement routes that add a string or integer to `params` when a request is made. Create a dynamic route that takes in a location ('/post/:location), returning "Hello from sunny #{location}".

Have student repeat dynamic route creation 5-10 times as a drill.
